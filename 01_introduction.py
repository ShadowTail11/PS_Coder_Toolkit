# Welcome Script: Your First Steps into Python

# Note that any line that starts with "#" is a comment to provide explanations about the code
# Lines that start with "#" and blank lines do not perform any function when the code is run.
# Comment lines are very important and should often take up more space than the code itself.
# This is to ensure that the reader of the code knows (or remembers) what everything does.

# This script is designed to help you get started with Python programming. 
# It's tailored for beginners, so don't worry if you've never written a line of code before! 
# Let's dive in and explore what each part of this script does.

# Step 1: Prompting the User
# The first part of the script asks for your name. 
# We use the 'input' function to get input from the user, and we store it in a variable called 'name'.
# When you run the function, the prompt will show up in the terminal below where you can type your response.

name = input("What is your name?\n")

# Step 2: Personalized Greeting
# Now that we have your name, we want to greet you personally. 
# We use the 'print' function to display a message. 
# Here, we're using string concatenation to combine the greeting with the name you provided.

print("Hello, " + name + "! Nice to meet you!")

# It may seem simple, but every great journey starts with a single step. 
# Feel free to explore, experiment, and most importantly, have fun with Python!
